            QualOpt is a platform for software engineering researchers to manage survey invitations for their qualitative research studies, and find participants to send them to via GitHub.
            The goal of this is to address the issue of GitHub users receiving too many unsolicited survey invitations via the GHTorrent project.
            We do this by providing a centralized location for researchers to find GitHub users, and for GitHub users to manage who can find them.

                    Researchers can use this application to send out survey invitations in moderation.<br/>
                    You can create a study on the application, with details of your survey and draft the email to be sent to your participants.<br/>
                    Additionally, you can filter the participants who will receive the survey invitations using information from GitHub.<br/>
                    This is great if you want easy contact to a tailored set of willing participants for your surveys.

                    further developed by the students of SoftEng 701. QualOpt was developed under the supervision of Dr Kelly Blincoe.
